[![objectscriptquality](https://github.com/rcemper/native-api-command-line-py/actions/workflows/objectscript-quality.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rcemper/native-api-command-line-py/actions/workflows/objectscript-quality.yml)   

This is the Python client for IRIS NativeAPI Command Extension   
It demonstrates using the extension without ObjectScript   

For easy testing, an IRIS instance with a demo Global and    
a pre-installed NativeAPI Command Line Extension is added. 
### Prerequisites    
Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed.  
If you want to use IPM installation make sure your IRIS instance    
has **irisnative** installed as described in detail in [the related repo](https://github.com/intersystems/quickstarts-python/tree/master)  
For Docker, this is already pre-loaded.   

### Installation   
Clone/git pull the repo into any local directory  

````    
git https://github.com/rcemper/native-api-command-line-py    
````    
   
Run the IRIS container with your project:   

````
docker-compose up -d --build    
````
### How to Test it    
<p><pre>docker-compose exec iris python3 src/rcc.py

If you prefer to test it with **embedded Python** use   
````
docker-compose exec iris iris session iris "##class(nacl.rcc).py()"    
````
